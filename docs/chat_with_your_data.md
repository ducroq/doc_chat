# Chat with your data solutions

RAG is currently popular because it balances effectiveness, cost, and implementation complexity. Each alternative has specific trade-offs around data size limits, training requirements, and maintenance complexity. Alternatively, fine-tuning an LLM directly on your data is an option.

# RAG Implementation Options Comparison

| Aspect | Self-Hosted | Cloud Services | Hybrid |
|--------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Data Privacy** | Maximum control, data stays on premises, compliance-friendly | Data leaves premises, requires vendor agreements, potential compliance issues | Data processing on premises, only queries to cloud LLM |
| **Setup Complexity** | High - requires infrastructure setup, software installation, integration | Low - minimal setup, managed services | Medium - local infrastructure needed but reduced complexity |
| **Maintenance** | High - regular updates, monitoring, troubleshooting required | Low - vendor managed updates and maintenance | Medium - split responsibility between local and cloud components |
| **Scalability** | Limited by local hardware (10-100 concurrent users) | High (1000+ users), automatic scaling | Depends on local infrastructure, typically medium (100-500 users) |
| **Initial Cost** | High - hardware, setup labor, software licenses | Low - usually pay-as-you-go | Medium - some hardware costs, reduced setup complexity |
| **Per-Query Cost** | Low - mainly power and maintenance | Medium to High ($0.01-0.10 per query) | Medium - split between local costs and API fees |
| **Example Solutions** | LocalGPT, custom LlamaIndex implementation | Azure AI Search, Amazon Kendra | Hybrid LangChain with cloud LLM |
| **Best For** | High privacy requirements, technical teams, cost-sensitive at scale | Quick deployment, scalability needs, limited IT resources | Balance of control and convenience, moderate scale |

# European/independent options

European Cloud Providers:
- Mistral AI (French) - Offers AI/LLM services
- OVHcloud (French) - Enterprise cloud with AI capabilities
- T-Systems (German) - Enterprise solutions
- Scaleway (French) - Cloud infrastructure

Independent Vector DB/Search:
- Weaviate (Dutch company)
- Qdrant (Originally Russian, now EU-based)
- Milvus (Open source, can self-host)

These typically offer:
- GDPR compliance
- EU data sovereignty
- Transparent pricing
- Open source components

For maximum independence, consider self-hosting using open source tools like Weaviate or Qdrant combined with local LLMs or European LLM providers.


# The basic workflow would be:
1. Load documents into Weaviate
2. Weaviate chunks and creates embeddings
3. Connect to Mistral API for LLM responses
4. Query system finds relevant chunks using vector search
5. Mistral LLM generates answers based on retrieved context

Benefits:
- EU-based solution
- GDPR compliant
- Self-hosted data control
- Good documentation/community
- Scales well with large documents
