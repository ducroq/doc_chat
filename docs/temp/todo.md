### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add basic authentication for web interface
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Add API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Add content filtering for document ingestion

Immediate Priorities

Implement Authentication:

Add basic authentication for the web interface and API
Implement JWT or API key-based authentication for programmatic access

Network Security:

Place your system behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx with properly configured security headers)
Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests
Restrict access to internal components like Weaviate to your application network only


Input Validation:

Implement strict input validation for all API endpoints
Add content filtering for document ingestion


Secure Deployment:

Use secrets management solutions rather than environment variables
Implement regular security updates for all components
Enable Docker content trust to verify container images
