Next Steps
Based on your todo list and the current status, here's what I'd recommend focusing on:

Fix the document processor issues:

Implement better error handling around chunk deletion
Add more logging to track the document processing flow

TextFileHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
We are using a tracker, so  update json if something changes. has this been done now?




Verify the data storage:

Use the API to query for stored documents
Check if vector embeddings are being created correctly


Complete end-to-end testing:

Test document upload → processing → querying → response generation
Test with various document types and query formats


Improve the prompt engineering for Mistral AI:

Refine the system prompt in the chat endpoint
Adjust temperature and other generation parameters


Add basic document statistics:

Implement an API endpoint to show document counts, total chunks, etc.



Would you like me to provide specific code implementations for any of these areas? I can help with debugging the processor, improving the chunking strategy, or enhancing the API endpoints.

# EU-Compliant RAG System: Debug & Prototype Todo List

## Debugging & Testing Priority
- [ ] Test document ingestion flow with sample text files
- [ ] Debug document processor watchdog functionality

- [ ] Evaluate user feedback mechanisms

## Notes
- Focus on getting a stable, functioning prototype before adding features
- Prioritize debugging the core RAG functionality
- Document issues encountered for future reference
- Test with realistic document scenarios from intended use case
